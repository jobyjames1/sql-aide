**If you know it, show the Typescript you want to write**

What Typescript code do you want to write that would create the proper SQL you
want?

```typescript
// the Typescript code you propose should work
```

**Expected behavior**

SQLa is a code generator that usually generates SQL so include what SQL you
_want_ generated (even if you don't know the Typescript, you should be able to
tell us what SQL you want). Include a full example of the SQL block.

```sql
--- the expected SQL goes here
```
